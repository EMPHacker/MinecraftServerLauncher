# MinecraftServerLauncher
An easy graphical launcher for Minecraft servers.
Usefull for personal servers that you're constantly turning on and off and loading with different worlds and/or versions.


FEATURES:

Keep track of Minecraft server versions and worlds and choose on to run from the dropdown.

Slider to easily adjust the RAM avaliable to the server.

Custom Message of the Day (MOTD). Type in your own or pick a random one from the list of Minecraft splash texts (requires motd.txt, will fix eventually)

Create a backup of your world before the server launches, very useful if you happen to select the wrong version and suddently notice the heavily modded world you've put hours upon hours into building massive industrial systems is strangely empty...

As well as a checkbox for NoGUI, there is a field for inputing any sort of Custom Java arguments you desire.


INSTALLATION:

This is a standalone executable, simply place the exe in the same folder as your Minecraft server and run it. (NOTE: requires server.properties to be present, else it errors). For random MOTDs the motds.txt file must also be in the directory.


KEY NOTES:

Worlds are recorgnized by the .world folder extension.
Minecraft versions are recorgnized by a filename including 'minecraft_server' and the .jar extension.
